Write a function that reverses all the words in a sentence that start with a particular letter.

Examples
specialReverse("word searches are super fun", "s")
➞ "word sehcraes are repus fun"

specialReverse("first man to walk on the moon", "m")
➞ "first nam to walk on the noom"

specialReverse("peter piper picked pickled peppers", "p")
➞ "retep repip dekcip delkcip sreppep"

/*
Create a recursive function that takes a string and returns the first character that 
repeats. If there is no repeat of a character, return "-1".

firstRepeat("legolas") ➞ "l"

firstRepeat("Gandalf") ➞ "a"

firstRepeat("Balrog") ➞ "-1"

/*
Write a JavaScript function which accepts a number as input and insert dashes 
(-) between each two even digits. For example if you accept 25468 the output should be "254-6-8"

/* Create a function 'amplify' that takes a number and returns an array from 1 to the given number, where: If the number can be 
divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the number) and if the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply 
return the number. For example, if we pass the number 5 to the function 'amplify' it should return the array [1, 2, 3, 40, 5] */

/* Declare a function filterByLength, that takes an array of words and a number as arguments. This function should return a new 
array containing only the words that are longer than the number provided.*/


/*
Split Strings

Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number 
of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

splitStrings('abc'); // should return ['ab', 'c_']
splitStrings('abcdef'); // should return ['ab', 'cd', 'ef'];
